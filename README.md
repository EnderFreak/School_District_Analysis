## Insights

#### BUDGET
Public schools seems to have a higher budget than Charter schools; 872,625 for Charter schools.

#### ENROLLMENT
Some schools have higher student enrollment compared to others. For example, Montgomery High School has over 2K students, almost 12x as much students as Chang High School which has the lowest number of students enrolled (171 students).

#### SCORING
Charter schools students tend to have a higher math score grade than Public school students, except for Grade 12, where Public schools have a higher average math score.

Additionally, the lowest math score in the dataset is from a student, Matthew Thomas in grade 10 from Dixon High School (a Charter school) with a score of 58.4, lower than the averages of both types of schools from that grade.

Irrespective of type of school, reading scores are higher than math scores, with an average of 74.9 in reading vs 63.3 in math.
